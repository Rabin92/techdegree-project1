      <p>I'm Rabin, currently living in the United Kingdom. I graduated from the University of East London on Computing. I developed my interest in Web Development during college as I found coding very fun &amp; interesting. I love everything about websites.</p>
      <p>I have experience working for a retail company as a store supervisor where my role was to interact with customers effectively &amp; provide great customer service.</p>
